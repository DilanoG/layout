                    <h3>Counter-Strike Global Offensive: Remade Map</h3>
                    <p>The most iconic map in Counter-Strike is making a comeback, and it's arriving much sooner than expected.</p>
                    <p>Valve announced on Twitter earlier today that an updated and revamped version of Dust II is being debuted in the next CS:GO beta depot. The time frame of the beta drop is still unclear, but it's very likely that it may arrive in the coming weeks. The last game update was Oct. 5, which consisted of small, additional changes to the molotov-smoke bug fix.<a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/dust2">Read More</a></p>

                    <p>On October 9th, 2007, Team Fortress 2 was released to the world. Also some other games shipped too, in a game collection called The Orange Box, but between you and us, we were never really happy with how it was marketed:<a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/">Read More</a></p>

                    <h3>Dragon Ball FighterZ</h3>
                    <p>The Dragon Ball FighterZ roster continues to expand. Three more characters have been announced for the upcoming fighting game, including an entirely original one who will play a prominent role in the game's story mode.</p>
                    <p>In the most recent issue of Japanese magazine V-Jump (as translated by Gematsu), Bandai Namco revealed that longtime Dragon Ball heroes Yamcha and Tien Shinhan will both be playable characters in Dragon Ball FighterZ. Yamcha is described as a close-range fighter who uses "surprise attacks," including his signature Wolf Fang Fist. Tien, meanwhile, is a versatile character who can unleash a variety of techniques in battle, such as the Tri-Beam and Dodon Ray. He can also call on his companion Chiaotzu, who can "seal the opponent's movement" using his telekinetic abilities.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the classic fighters, V-Jump revealed that a brand-new character named Android 21 will also appear in Dragon Ball FighterZ and is a "central figure" in the game's what-if story mode. She is described as a scientist whose intelligence is on par with the villainous Dr. Gero, and it appears she has some connection to Android 16's revival; in the magazine, each screenshot depicts her standing next to the resurrected fighter.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-fighterz-adds-two-classic-characters-a/1100-6453397/">Read More</a></p> </p>
